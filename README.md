**CamelJS** - An opensource Javascript library for 3D game development, 
**CamelJS** is a cross-platform, royalty-free web standard for a high 
level 3D graphics API based on WebGL, exposed to ECMAScript via the HTML5 
Canvas element. Developers familiar with OpenGL ES 2.0 will recognize 
WebGL as a Shader-based API using GLSL, with constructs that are 
semantically similar to those of the underlying OpenGL ES API. It stays 
very close to the OpenGL ES specification, with some concessions made 
for what developers expect out of memory-managed languages such as JavaScript.

WebGL brings plugin-free 3D to the web, implemented right into the browser. 
Major browser vendors Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), 
and Mozilla (Firefox) are members of the WebGL Working Group.
